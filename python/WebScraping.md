# Web Scraping using Python

## Hint: add headers from web browers to look more like actual users

* There are a few free-to-use website can show your HTTP headers when visting the sites. One of the example is http://myhttpheader.com/

* Copy the headers information from that page and create a `headers` dict in the code for the `requests` package to use.
